# PacketTransmissionControl8086
This assembly code is designed to simulate a packet transmission process on an 8086 microprocessor.<br>
It prompts the user to enter the number of packets to be transmitted and then performs the transmission simulation.<br>
The program keeps track of the number of transmitted packets and the total number of transmissions madeand also detects when 128 cycles of packet transmission have been completed.
